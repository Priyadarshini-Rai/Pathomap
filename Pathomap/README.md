## Description

Pathomap provides a strategy to obtain an unbiased continuous representation of disease causing genes and their tissue specificity.

### Dependencies

Packages: devtools, gganatogram, ggplot2, ggploypath, gridExtra, magrittr, plotly

### Excecution

To install the *Pathomap* R package use the following command:

```ruby
setwd('*Path to the Pathomap folder*')
devtools::install()

**OR**

install.packages(‘"*Path to the Pathomap folder*"’, repos = NULL, type = “source”)
```

```
# Loading data
Processed_Data = read.table('Single Cell Dataset/PBMC_Data_1019Samples.csv', sep = ',', header = FALSE)
```

```
# Number of features user wants to select
Number_of_Features = 50
```

```
# Calling SelfE
GeneIDs = SelfE(Processed_Data, Number_of_Features)
```

```
# Selecting genes from the data
SelfE_Data = Processed_Data[, GeneIDs]
```
